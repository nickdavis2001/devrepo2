to make a docker dev image, cd into the dir where the Dockerfile is, 

we need to build the docker image, e:g

docker build . -t pythontest

then we run it like this :

docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workdir pythontest bash

-it run it interactive
-v sets current working directory as the volume.  can use home dir instead, this might be more useful
pythontest is name of the image we just built
bash is what we want to run

so, :
docker run -it -v ~:/workdir pythontest bash


ultimately might want to alias d to do this
